Welcome to Speakeasy, a cooperatively-minded social networking platform focused on privacy and community. These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of Speakeasy's services, including our website, mobile applications, and any other linked services (collectively, the "Services").

You must be at least 13 years old to use Speakeasy. By using Speakeasy, you represent and warrant that you meet this age requirement and that you are legally permitted to use the Services under applicable laws.

### Compliance with Bluesky Terms
Your use of Speakeasy also requires compliance with Bluesky's Terms of Service, as Speakeasy operates on the Bluesky platform. By using Speakeasy, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by Bluesky's Terms of Service in addition to these Terms.

### Accounts
To access most features of Speakeasy, you must register for an account. You agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information during the registration process and to update such information to keep it accurate, current, and complete.

You are responsible for safeguarding your account credentials and for all activities that occur under your account. You agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your account.

Users may maintain multiple accounts, but may not use multiple accounts to evade enforcement actions, harass others, or artificially inflate engagement.

## 2. User Content

### Your Content
"User Content" refers to any content that you submit, post, or transmit through the Services, including text, images, photos, videos, links, and any other materials.

We reserve the right, but are not obligated, to monitor or review User Content. We may remove or restrict access to any User Content for any reason, including violations of these Terms or our Community Guidelines, without notice.

## 7. Disclaimers

The Services are provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind, either express or implied, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, and non-infringement.

Speakeasy does not warrant that the Services will be uninterrupted or error-free, that defects will be corrected, or that the Services or the servers that make the Services available are free of viruses or other harmful components.

Speakeasy makes no guarantees regarding the reliability, accuracy, or quality of any content obtained through the Services.

## 8. Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Speakeasy shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or revenues, whether incurred directly or indirectly, or any loss of data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from:

- Your access to or use of or inability to access or use the Services
- Any conduct or content of any third party on the Services
- Any content obtained from the Services
- Unauthorized access, use, or alteration of your transmissions or content

Nothing in these Terms shall exclude or limit our liability for death or personal injury resulting from our negligence or for any other liability that cannot be excluded or limited by New Zealand law.

## 9. Indemnification

You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Speakeasy and its officers, directors, employees, and agents from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable legal and accounting fees, arising out of or in any way connected with your access to or use of the Services, your User Content, or your violation of these Terms.

## 10. Governing Law and Jurisdiction

These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of New Zealand, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.

Any dispute arising from or relating to the subject matter of these Terms shall be finally settled by the courts of New Zealand, and you consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts.

## 11. Changes to Terms

We may modify these Terms at any time. If we make changes, we will provide notice by posting the updated Terms on our Services and updating the "Last Updated" date. Your continued use of the Services after any such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms.

## 12. General Terms

These Terms, together with our Privacy Policy and Community Guidelines, constitute the entire agreement between you and Speakeasy regarding your use of the Services.

If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be struck and the remaining provisions shall be enforced. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision.

Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of such right or provision.
