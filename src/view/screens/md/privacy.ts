## Introduction

This Privacy Policy explains how Speakeasy ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and shares your personal information when you use our application and services (collectively, the "Services"). Speakeasy is a client application that operates on the Bluesky platform and the AT Protocol.

This Privacy Policy should be read alongside [Bluesky's Privacy Policy](https://bsky.app/privacy), as Speakeasy operates on the Bluesky platform and utilizes Bluesky's infrastructure.
